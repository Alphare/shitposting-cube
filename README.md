# Shitposting Cube
Makes any string into a shitposting cube, ready to use in pcj. Special thanks to [stone_henge](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/8axnso/in_go_the_programmer_is_encouraged_to_handle/dx5hzj9/) for the original algorithm, however, since Python only has the lol too slow variant and the lol not turing complete variant I decided to rewrite it in a real, 4D webscale, futuristic language like Go, then ditched it all and rewrote it in OCaml for wageslaves

# Roadmap
I'll make it into SaaS (Shitposting as a Service), put up a webservice and maybe transcompile it to JavaScript, post it as an npm package and get 10 million downloads a day because if is-even can do it so can I. Until then, it's only available in OCaml Enterprise Edition&trade;, so enjoy and don't forget to spam "lol no hkts"
