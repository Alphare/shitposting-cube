# Shitposting Cube
Makes any string into a shitposting cube, ready to use in pcj. 

# Roadmap
I'll make it into SaaS (Shitposting as a Service), put up a webservice and maybe transcompile it to JavaScript, post it as an npm package and get 10 million downloads a day because if is-even can do it so can I. Until then, it's only available in OCaml Enterprise Edition&trade;, so enjoy and don't forget to spam "lol no hkts"
