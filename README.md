# Shitposting Cube
Makes any string into a shitposting cube, ready to use in [pcj](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/). Special thanks to [stone_henge](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/8axnso/in_go_the_programmer_is_encouraged_to_handle/dx5hzj9/) for the original algorithm, however, since Python only has the lol too slow variant and the lol not turing complete variant I decided to rewrite it in a real, 4D webscale, futuristic language like Go, then ditched it all and rewrote it in OCaml for wageslaves

# Features
Well, it's a webservice now, albeit it runs on localhost. You can now clone this repo, open it with Visual Studio and compile it, then run it and visit localhost:8080/cubepost?cube= and indicate on the querystring what to cube. It'll return a plain text answer containing the cubed string. I use [Suave](https://suave.io/) for the webserver because it's the ~~only one with a logo hipster enough for me~~ most decent webserver I found that's wrote on F# so you're stuck with it too. 

# Roadmap
 * ~~I'll make it into SaaS (Shitposting as a Service) by putting up a webservice~~ I'll put the webservice somewhere in the actual web so you don't have to clone the repo, compile it and run it locally, but it runs now
 * Maybe I'll transcompile it to JavaScript, post it as an npm package and get 10 million downloads a day because if is-even can do it so can I.
 * I may also port it to VB.NET because @fukkaudekku once said it's best language and I realized she's right.
 * Until then, it's only available in OCaml Enterprise Edition&trade;, so enjoy and don't forget to spam "lol no hkts"

# Conclusion
This is mainly a proof of concept to get a grasp of how to do web development on F#. Nothing of this is to be taken seriously, although I do plan on expanding this to add several different templates for "ASCII art" with strings. Feel free to use it, clone it, spam lol no hkts or do whatever with it.
